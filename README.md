# Dooze

**Dooze** is an web App created at TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon 2016.


## Inspiration
Dooze is inspired by the fact that a vast amount of people including the creators of this product have significant problems to get up in the mornings. Nowadays, snoozing before officially getting out of bed has become a pretty standard practice. One survey found that more than a third of American adults hit the snooze button at least three times each morning, and more than half of people ages 25 to 34 press snooze daily.
The catch: Many sleep experts agree that hitting the snooze button contributes to a tired morning and doesnâ€™t help us feel more rested, although we may believe the opposite is true. Dooze is supposed to solve this issue.

## What it does
Dooze is a convenient way to force you out of bed in the mornings. Before you go to sleep, you set an alarm with Alexa, telling her what to you what to get up - nothing special until now. Once your alarm goes off, Dooze will give you a chance to get up, however if you snooze, the app will charge you a predefined amount of money. It starts small and gets bigger with the time.
If you pass a certain threshold, Dooze will automatically notify a friend a friend through an SMS to take action, so that you do not miss your 8 AM class or an important appointment with a client.

## How we built it
Dooze leverages three APIs: Amazon Alexa, Twilio and Braintree. We are using JavaScript in the front-end and Ruby Rails in the backend to process server requests.
